# PlannerHw

Here is my functioning submission of the Daily Planner assignment. Per the prompt, I did everything in dynamically updated HTML and CSS with jQuery.
I struggled in writing a for loop for setting and getting local storage items, so the functions are all seperate. I will ask a tutor a better way of doing things, 
but it is all functional.
